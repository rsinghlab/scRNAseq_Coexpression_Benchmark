We use eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets in this study. 
We extract data of four different sequencing protocols from [mouse cortex](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP425/single-cell-comparison-cortex-data\#study-summary) dataset and [human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP424/single-cell-comparison-pbmc-data\#study-summary) dataset downloaded from [Single Cell Protal](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell).
